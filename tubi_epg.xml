And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250406060000 +0000" stop="20250406070000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E12 - Episode 12</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250406070000 +0000" stop="20250406080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S01:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250406080000 +0000" stop="20250406090000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250406090000 +0000" stop="20250406100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250406100000 +0000" stop="20250406110000 +0000"><title>Next Level Chef (UK)</title><desc>The competition is heating up on Next Level Chef, as the remaining 10 cooks must make the perfect Burger.
