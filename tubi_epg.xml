Aoudad were introduced to Texas as an exotic species and it didn't take long for them to establish a large viable population in the ideal habitat that West Texas offers. Going into this hunt with the confidence and extended range that only Gunwerks can provide, Mark knows the odds are in his favor and it doesn't take long to come across multiple bands of rams.

Chance and Ashleigh Eckert are on their first out-of-state hunt in the rolling hills of Ohio. After overcoming a life-changing kidney transplant, their story is one of faith, love, and resilience. While the goal was a big buck, the true reward was the time spent together and the lessons learned along the way.

The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250413030025 +0000" stop="20250413033049 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>With a laundry list of things to do on the Dirty Bird, Randy finds himself in a pickle when Cody just up and disappears.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250413033049 +0000" stop="20250413040049 +0000"><title>Full Strut</title><desc>After Shawn filled his Missouri tag, it was Rex &amp; Chandler's turn to attempt at harvesting their birds!

The reason for this selflessness goes deep into the roots of what drives hunters to hunt.In this episode of The Huntsman Chris and KC are back for another Australian hunting adventure. Continuing off the back of their successful camel hunt it's KC's turn to fill the freezer and he's got his sights set on both wild goat and rusa deer. In these moments, the joy comes from knowing you've played a part in someone else's achievement. It's a selfless joy that resonates deeper and lasts longer. This is what makes hunting more than just a sport—it's a way of life that fosters respect, gratitude, and an enduring sense of community.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250413030025 +0000" stop="20250413033049 +0000"><title>The Raven Project</title><desc>With a laundry list of things to do on the Dirty Bird, Randy finds himself in a pickle when Cody just up and disappears.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20250413033049 +0000" stop="20250413040049 +0000"><title>Full Strut</title><desc>After Shawn filled his Missouri tag, it was Rex &amp; Chandler's turn to attempt at harvesting their birds!

The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250412124100 +0000" stop="20250412142900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250412142900 +0000" stop="20250412161700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250412195200 +0000" stop="20250412214000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village.

Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20250413011600 +0000" stop="20250413031600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The closing of what was once a very popular public garden in Midsomer Deverell sparks a series of murders that have Inspector Barnaby and Sgt.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250413205600 +0000" stop="20250413215700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250413225700 +0000" stop="20250413235700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250413235700 +0000" stop="20250414005700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><channel id="715948"><display-name>Family
