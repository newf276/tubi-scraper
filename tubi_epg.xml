Pro Wrestler Mikey takes on Wipeout Australias very own Tom Cruise. Its neck and neck through the qualifier which this week includes a real Mission Impossible, Dirty Balls. The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory. Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250409203814 +0000" stop="20250409215134 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This time you will see a new obstacle in 'The Qualifier', called 'Dodgeball Men.'</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250409215134 +0000" stop="20250409230437 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Will Ali the penguin keeper slip and slide his way to success on the Qualifier?</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250409230437 +0000" stop="20250410001744 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>It’s Christmas down on the Winter Wipeout course in Argentina!</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410001744 +0000" stop="20250410013055 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Can magician Darren run the travellator and cross the Big Red Balls?</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410013055 +0000" stop="20250410024402 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Today’s courageous band of volunteers include a former world class athlete intent on making a comeback.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410024402 +0000" stop="20250410033911 +0000"><title>The Almost Impossible Gameshow</title><desc>Another episode of the game show in which 50 members of the public compete - with almost no chance of winning.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410033911 +0000" stop="20250410043357 +0000"><title>The Almost Impossible Gameshow</title><desc>Another episode of the game show in which 50 members of the public compete - with almost no chance of winning.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410043357 +0000" stop="20250410052640 +0000"><title>The Almost Impossible Gameshow</title><desc>Another episode of the game show in which 50 members of the public compete - with almost no chance of winning.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410052640 +0000" stop="20250410063944 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In the first episode of season 3, Richard Hammond introduces a brand new challenge called Crash Mountain.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410063944 +0000" stop="20250410075303 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Twenty foolhardy Brits attempt to conquer the purpose-built obstacle course in Argentina.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410075303 +0000" stop="20250410084904 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>20 ordinary Canadians will compete in the world’s largest most extreme obstacle course designed to provide the most spills, thrills and fantastic fumbles ever seen on television.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410084904 +0000" stop="20250410094504 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Log Roll, Wall Swing, The Ring, Tippy Tables, and Cylinder Run are among the over-the-top obstacles in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410094504 +0000" stop="20250410110014 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Contestants are ejected from the show in the craziest and most outrageous ways possible.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410110014 +0000" stop="20250410121335 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Richard's co-host Amanda Byram is course-side in Buenos Aires as 20 Brits tackle the Argentinian course.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410121335 +0000" stop="20250410132641 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the last episode of the season and the 7 previous winners compete to be the Champion of Champions.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410132641 +0000" stop="20250410144149 +0000"><title>101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow</title><desc>Steve Jones hosts the series where contestants are ejected in the most nerve-wracking means ever seen on TV.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20250410144149 +0000" stop="20250410153706 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250410203200 +0000" stop="20250410213200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250410213200 +0000" stop="20250410222700
