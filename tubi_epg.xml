We’ve got a packed episode breaking down all the chaos from last weekend, including Army’s dominant win, Maryland’s bounce back, and whether Notre Dame is peaking at the right time. Ohio State’s Caleb “Big Tasty” Fyock joins the show to talk about the origins of his legendary nickname, Ohio State’s  turnaround, and the best shooter he’s seen in the past two years. We also dive into Duke’s struggles, whether Matt Danowski’s seat is heating up, and the ongoing battle for the best defense in the country. Plus, a deep dive into the PLL draft, betting odds, and whether CJ Kirst should be the #1 pick in 2025. We wrap things up with Mitch’s Mailbox and some heated Start-Bench-Cut debates.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000157" start="20250410220000 +0000" stop="20250410233000 +0000"><title>2025 Lexus Championship Series</title><desc>PLL: New York Atlas vs Utah Archers from February 14, 2025</desc></programme><programme channel="400000157" start="20250410233000 +0000" stop="20250411010000 +0000"><title>2025 Lexus Championship Series</title><desc>PLL: Boston Cannons vs Utah Archers from February 12, 2025</desc></programme><programme channel="400000157" start="20250411010000 +0000" stop="20250411013000 +0000"><title>2024 Player's Top 50 Fueled by Gatorade</title><desc>Join Paul Carcaterra and Ryan Boyle in studio as they break down this year's Player's Top 50 Fueled by Gatorade.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000157" start="20250411013000 +0000" stop="20250411023000 +0000"><title>2025 Golden Stick Award Race</title><desc>The Golden Stick Award is an award given to the player who accumulates the most scoring points throughout the Championship Series.

But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250411141600 +0000" stop="20250411144200 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250411144200 +0000" stop="20250411150800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20250411150800 +0000" stop="20250411153400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250410213200 +0000" stop="20250410222700 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>The team fly to the rescue after separate crashes at a motorcycle race leave several spectators with serious injuries.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250410222700 +0000" stop="20250410232200 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250410232200 +0000" stop="20250411001800 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Fly along with helicopter doctors and paramedics of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, where cutting-edge modern emergency medicine saves lives every day.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250411001800 +0000" stop="20250411011800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Pash whips a dominatrix into shape; Sketch cleans up Alex's ridiculous rhyme; Alice disguises charmer Dean's brag; Uzzi helps Rhys cover up his past desires.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250411011800 +0000" stop="20250411021700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250411021700 +0000" stop="20250411031800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>When 21 year old chef Tim sold "fine dining" to Bonapartes bistro, they assumed he could cook.
