The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250407211600 +0000" stop="20250407221600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250407221600 +0000" stop="20250407231600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250407231600 +0000" stop="20250408000800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to the Juniper Hill Inn in Windsor, VT, a place that looks like a million dollars but smells of raw sewage.

The brazen daytime shooting of employees from the Central Intelligence Agency stunned the country.  The victims seemed randomly selected, but the motive appeared to be political. The FBI was called in, but the nationwide search quickly became a far-reaching international manhunt. Agents processed more than 2000 leads and crossed an ocean in the effort to deliver justice.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250408214700 +0000" stop="20250408225200 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Kokomo, Indiana an unthinkable crime terrified residents. A young woman was snatched from her home on a bright spring morning.  Drops of blood and a torn window screen were all that was left to tell authorities what happened to the twenty-one year old victim. After several days of searching, a former FBI profiler narrowed the suspect list to one. Agents and detectives followed the trail across state lines hoping to find the victim before her time ran out.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250408225200 +0000" stop="20250408235900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Anchorage, Alaska, a young mother and her two daughters were sexually assaulted and brutally murdered.  There was only one piece of forensic evidence: a washrag carrying pubic lice that the killer used to clean himself after the crime.  Employing an unusual and original method, an FBI expert combed through all the hairs and fibers in the apartment.  He was not only able to determine how long each hair had been there, but which hairs came from the killer and how the crime proceeded.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20250408235900 +0000" stop="20250409010200 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the late 80's, Florida's cocaine imports were among the highest in the nation.  Regional territories were enforced with intimidation and murder.  Desperate to stop the violence, local authorities turned to the FBI for help. One dealer bowed to no one.  He would stop at nothing to keep detectives and agents from building a case against him.
